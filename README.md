# SensioLabs Connect SDK

## About

This is the official SDK for the SensioLabs Connect API. It works for the
public API or with a registered OAuth application. To register an application,
please go to your [SensioLabs Connect Account](https://connect.sensiolabs.com).

Warning: This SDK is in beta state.

## Installation

Add `sensiolabs/connect` to the list of requirements of your applications's
composer.json file.

## Usage

### OAuth

This part will show you how to include OAuth authentication within a Silex App.

Warning: We take for granted that you already have registered your app on
[SensioLabs Connect](https://connect.sensiolabs.com) and that you're in
possession of your application id, application secret and scope.

1. Configure your silex app with the data we gave us at app registration.

        // index.php
        use SensioLabs\Connect\Api\Api;

        $app = new Silex\Application();
        $app['connect_id'] = 'your_client_id';
        $app->register(new Silex\Provider\UrlGeneratorServiceProvider());
        $app->register(new Silex\Provider\SessionServiceProvider());

        $app['connect_secret'] = 'your_client_secret';
        // List of scope copy-pasted from your application page on SensioLabs Connect
        $app['connect_scope'] = array(
            'SCOPE_ADDITIONAL_EMAILS',
            'SCOPE_BIRTHDAY',
            'SCOPE_EMAIL',
            'SCOPE_LOCATION',
            'SCOPE_PRIVATE_MEMBERSHIPS',
            'SCOPE_PRIVATE_PROJECTS',
            'SCOPE_PUBLIC',
            'SCOPE_SSH_KEYS',
        );

        $app['connect_consumer'] = new OAuthConsumer(
            $app['connect_id'],
            $app['connect_secret'],
            implode(' ', $app['connect_scope']) // scope MUST be space separated
        );
        $app['connect_api'] = new Api();

    This done. We can now move on to the second step.

2. We need to create two controllers to handle the OAuth2 Three-Legged worflow.

   The first controller goal is to redirect the user to SensioLabs Connect in order
   to ask him for the authorization that your app will use his data. This controller
   will be bound to the `connect_auth` route. In your template, you'll need to create
   a link to this route.

        // index.php
        $app->get('/connect/new', function () use ($app) {
            $callback = $app['url_generator']->generate('connect_callback', array(), true);
            $url = $app['connect_consumer']->getAuthorizationUri($callback);

            return $app->redirect($url);
        })->bind('connect_auth');

    The second controller is the one that will welcome the user after
    SensioLabs Connect redirected him to your application. When registering your
    client, you'll have to provide the exact absolute URL that points to this
    controller.

        $app->get('/connect/callback', function (Request $request) use ($app) {
            // There was an error during the workflow.
            if ($request->get('error')) {
                throw new \RuntimeException($request->get('error_description'));
            }

            // Everything went fine, you can now request an access token.
            try {
                $data = $app['connect_consumer']->requestAccessToken($app['url_generator']->generate('connect_callback', array(), true), $request->get('code'));
            } catch (OAuthException $e) {
                throw $e;
            }

            // At this point, we have an access token and we can use the SDK to request the API
            $app['connect_api']->setAccessToken($data['access_token']); // All further request will be done with this access token
            $root = $app['connect_api']->getRoot();
            $user = $root->getCurrentUser();
            $user->getBadges()->refresh();

            $app['session']->start();
            $app['session']->set('connect_access_token', $data['access_token']);
            $app['session']->set('connect_user', $user);

            return $app->redirect('/');
        })->bind('connect_callback');

    Et voilÃ ! Your application can now use SensioLabs Connect as an authentication method!

### The API

The SensioLabs Connect API is RESTFul and (tries to) conforms to the HATEOAS principle.

Here are some useful recipies.

1. Search

        $root = $api->getRoot();

        // Will search for project with 'symfony' query
        $projects = $root->getProjects('symfony');

        // Same for users
        $users = $root->getUsers('fab');

        // Same for clubs
        $clubs = $root->getClubs('sensio');

2. Retrieves last created entities on SensioLabs Connect

        $root = $api->getRoot();

        // Will retrieves last created projects
        $projects = $root->getProjects();

        // Same for users
        $users = $root->getUsers();

        // Same for clubs
        $clubs = $root->getClubs();

3. Create a new club

        // Create Club
        $club = new \SensioLabs\Connect\Api\Entity\Club();
        $club->setName("SensioLabs France");
        $club->setSlug("sensiolabs-api-users");
        $club->setType(\SensioLabs\Connect\Api\Entity\Club::TYPE_USER_GROUP);
        $club->setEmail('foobar@example.com');
        $club->setDescription('This is the best description i found.');
        $club->setCity("Paris");
        $club->setCountry("France");
        $club->setUrl('http://sensiolabs.com');

        // Save new Club
        $app['connect_api']->setAccessToken($app['session']->get('connect_access_token'));
        $root = $app['connect_api']->getRoot();
        $response = $root->getClubs()->submitForm($club);

4. Edit authenticated user

        $app['connect_api']->setAccessToken($app['session']->get('connect_access_token'));
        $root = $app['connect_api']->getRoot();
        $user = $root->getCurrentUser();
        $user->setBiography("I'm sexy and I know it.");
        $user->submitForm();

As you can see by these examples, you always have to to go through the API Root
to make an action. This is because the API is discoverable and that the SDK
should not know anything beside the API's entry point.
